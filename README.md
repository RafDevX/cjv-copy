everything here is copied from [https://carjorvaz.com/](https://carjorvaz.com) as a practical joke, since he kept bugging me to get myself a website, instead of just using nginx's default page

all credit goes to him - permission to use and modify this was verbally obtained from him (the copyright holder)

you should know that only the generated, resulting code (the only statically served at the original website) was changed (after being downloaded via, not curl, but Ctrl+S in the browser) - the original hugo input content files were not used at all
